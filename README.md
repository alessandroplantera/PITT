# ⏰ PIT – Personal Training Alarm Clock

**PIT** is a personal training alarm clock designed to help you wake up and stay fit from the very first moment of your day.  
It turns your morning alarm into a small workout session — the alarm **can only be turned off** by completing a set of physical exercises.

## 🧠 Why PIT?

With a traditional alarm, it's easy to hit snooze and delay your wake-up, harming your **mental alertness** and breaking your morning routine.  
PIT forces you to **get moving**, boosting your metabolism and creating a healthier start to the day.

## 🏋️‍♂️ How It Works

- The user sets the alarm time and chooses the **number of repetitions** or type of exercise
- Once the alarm rings, a mini workout starts (e.g. squats, push-ups, jumping jacks)
- The user must **complete the exercises** tracked by sensors or the webcam (e.g. via computer vision or accelerometer)
- Only after completing the set, the alarm stops
